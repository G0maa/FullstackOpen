- Current progress: `Finished`:

  - Deployed link: https://part7bloglist.herokuapp.com/
  - If you want to play:
    - Try for username: `gomaa` password `security`
    - or username: `root` password `secret` or `sekret`

- This is where I made forntend related excercises of `part7` of `FullstackOpen 2022`, keep in mind, this frontend repo had the starting code found [here](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/bloglist-frontend).
- Tech stack: `MERN`.

  - Deployment: `Heroku`,
  - Database: `cloud.mongodb.com`
  - state management: `Redux Toolkit`
  - testing:
    - ~~Unit tests: `Jest`~~, Ignored after realizing `Redux Toolkit` needs some further learning.
    - Integration tests (API Tests): `Jest and Supertest`
    - E2E testing: `Cypress`

- Optional to-do:

  - Use third party UI framework as learned in `part7` ‚úÖ
    - I tried to find the easiest, simplest and somewhat "official" one, ended up with `semantic-ui`.
  - do Tests as learned in `part5` ‚úÖ
  - do deployment as learned in `part3` ‚úÖ

- [Main repo link](https://github.com/OoMiDOoO/FullstackOpen), I can't submit many repos to the system so files of this repo will be copied there eventually.
- P.S: I had a `.git` renamed to `git_folder` and `.gitignore`ed, so you might see more commits than in the main repo...

- Actual to-dos:

  - Check if `Prerttier` actually works "automatically": ‚úÖ
  - Hide 'create new blog' form after submitting a new blog (and make it toggleable): ‚úÖ
  - Group forms in a single hook: ‚ùå
  - Refreshing URL of `/X/:id` will not work
    - ‚ùì `useEffect` execution order for `Users` makes this not work.
  - Need to `navigate` to other routes when both have successful execution only.
    - ‚ùì for login form only.

- Actual self-notes:

  - Are there a better way for error handling for ReactJS other than `try catch`?
  - ~~In some (all?) cases I decided to group related components together than separating them into their respective files.~~ Bad decision don't do it.
  - You don't have to specify which property of the state you are changing in the reducers, e.g. you have `notification` and `blogs` in your `store`.
    - That is actually 100% true.

```JS
// This will not work
setNotification(state, action) {
  const notificationState = state.notification
  // remaining logic
}
// You can directly do this:
setNotification(state, action) {
  return {
    message: action.payload,
    type: 'normal',
  }
}
```

- Redux Toolkit creates some vague code:
  - You don't know how the state looks like from the code, unless you explicitly type some form of it in the initial state, which isn't correct, or comment it out.
  - You don't exactly know how the reducers change state if you `return action.payload`
  - You lean on the service for returning back a corectly formatted object.
    - If you have two "kinds" of the API, one summary and one detailed, if not formatted early, you will be in a situation where you have "two-states" in side of one state, aka... one detailed blog, and one summerized blog in our app at least... which is I suppose confusing.
- Actual mapping of Blogs to Users wouldn't be _that_ hard, and it means less request(s).
  - Which is better?
  - Scratched that idea off when I thought of all the work one would have to do if data changed in one place.
- You can't get to a specific user details without going to /users first, I guess that _kinda_ logical?
  - At least it should work when you do a refresh?
  - I was trying to save populate `blogs =[]` of each user when call to `/users/:id`, I didn't quite get it to work, so I switched to full monkey mode and created `queryUser` state, that saves state of each new query-ed user, now... there's no cache what-so-ever.
- (backend & frontend) about non-reflected modifications of object properties:
  - 1. Think of the returned type ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  - `Mongooose.save()` returns welp.. some kind of object, modifying using that object's schema properties _might not_ result in the intended output... you may access the acutal object through `obj._doc`
  - I made a terrible mistake, which cost(ed) me lots of time, tl;dr I didn't know how `array.filter()` actually works.
- A decision:

  - `fetchAllUsers()` and `fetchAllBlogs()`, which are the two main routes, are executed in `app` instead of their designated erm.. components, this was due to `useEffect` being executed in a different order... i.e. I will need to implement more logic to deal with refresh the website to `/users/:id` and `/blogs/:id` of which I decided to just skip.

- First thing after installing `Semantic UI React` is that you are faced with a webpack compilation error, tl;dr, there are double semi-colon in the CSS file you imported, this isssue is some-how not mentioned in the documentation.
  - There are a few [solutions](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/7073).
  - What I did:
    - Removed the `;` manually.
    - Removed `/node_modules/.cache` folder
    - Doubt of ever using `Semantic UI` again?
  - I just need a small, simple, easy, well documented, react-based UI library/framework to have a frontend to my backend, I guess I should've just went with `Bootstrap React`
    - I got the hang of `Semanti UI React` after ~3 Hours.
- `useEffects()` order of calling is based on the component getting rendered... i.e. that component `useEffect()` will get called first.
