- We will utilize containers to create immutable execution environments for our Node.js and React projects. Containers also make it easy to include multiple services with our projects.
- In this part we are interested in the configuration of the environment in which the software is executed.

### `Part 12: (A)` Introduction to Containers

- VMs are used to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. They have to run the whole operating system, whereas a container runs the software using the host operating system.

  - More accurately, containers are OS-level virtualization.

- About containers:
  - Lightweight, compared to VMs.
  - Quick to scale.
  - Isolate the software running inside; run the software identically anywhere; perfect for cloud environment.
- Scenarios:

  - Need to run two different versions of e.g. Nodejs at the same time on the same machine.
  - Need to run the application on different machine in the same erm.. excution manner? i.e. same environment.

- A container is a runtime instance of an image.
- Docker is a set of products that help us to manage images and containers.

  - Docker compose: "orchestrate" control multiple containers at the same time.
  - Docker daemon: background service that makes sure the containers are running
  - Docker client: Used to interact with the daemon.

- `it` makes sure we can interact with the container.
- There are lots of commands that I need to write here ðŸ˜¬

- `docker run -it <image-name>`
- `docker start -i <container-name>`

### `Part 12: (B)` Building and configuring environments

- `Dockerfile` is a simple text file that contains all of the instructions for creating an image.
- `CMD` instruction tells what happens when **`docker run`** is used
- `CMD` is the default command that can then be overwritten with the parameter given after the image name.
- `docker run -p host-port:application-port`, port from host to port from container.
- This is a critical thing to keep in mind when we build our images. It's best to do most things, such as to run `npm install` **during the build process** inside the container rather than doing those prior to building.
  - The easy rule of thumb is to only copy files that you would push to GitHub.
- About `ci` vs `install`:
  - `ci` sticks to `package-lock.json`,
  - also will delete `node_modules` before each instal.
  - `ci` creates reliable builds, while `install` is the one to use when you want to install new dependencies.
  - There's also `npm ci --only=production`
- About `Dockerfile` best practices:
  - Try to create as secure of an image as possible.
  - Try to create as small of an image as possible.

- The Seven things in `Dockerfile`
  - `FROM`, `WORKDIR`, `COPY`, `RUN`, `ENV`, `USER`, `CMD`.
- `Bind mount` is the act of binding a file on the host machine to a file in the container.
- start the MongoDB with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`. With `-d` it will run it in the background. You can view the output logs with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f`. There the `-f` will ensure we follow the logs.
- By default, **containers are not going to preserve our data**, to store the data:
  - Declaring a location in your filesystem (called bind mount)
  - Letting Docker decide where to store the data (volume)
- About the `MongoDB` parts:
  - First, there's the `mongo` image i.e. runtime of a MongoDB.
  - Second, we have the `app`, which is kind of not really attached to `MongoDB`.
  - The app is NOT containeraized, whilst the DB is.
  - DB needs `root` user details, defined in the `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
  - Also needs info about the user details that's going to try to connect it.
    - which is in `mongo-init.js`
  - Finally `app` needs to connect with `MongoDB` through `port` specified in `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
  - FinallyII => volumes are used to:
    - Share ``mongo-init.js`
    - Share output data of the `DB`
