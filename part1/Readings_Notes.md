#### Reading: [`re-introduction to JS`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
* Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser...
* `var` has scope of a function, `let` has scope of a block.
* JS had `function` scope till ES6, which introduced `let`.
* The length of the array is one more than the highest index.
* `for...of` => Iteratable objects, `for...in` ?iterates over keys?.
* You can call the functions without their parametrs, not gonna break the program.. mostly.
* `...var_name` works similar to logic programming. eugh..
* You can nest functions inside functions => less global functions. ?Although I find it ugly?
