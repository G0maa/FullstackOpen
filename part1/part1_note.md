### `Part 1: (b)` - Introduction to React
* "probably the most important topic of this course" ðŸ˜®
* "the file public/index.html doesn't contain any HTML markup that is visible to us in the browser."
* "when using React, all content that needs to be rendered is usually defined as React components."
* The layout of React components is mostly written using [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) Not HTML.
* Under the hood, JSX returned by React components is compiled into JavaScript.
* The compiling is handled by [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl/)"
* "JSX is "XML-like", which means that every tag needs to be closed."
* "a core philosophy of React is composing applications from many specialized reusable components."
* Some tips:
  * Advance in small steps, console (F12) should be always open in the beginning.
  * You can always try `console.log()`.
  * **React components must be capitalized** (first letter)ðŸ¤¨
  * React component (usually) needs to contain one root element.
  * You can skip having an added `<div>` element by using fragments `<> </>`.
