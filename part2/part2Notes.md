### `Part 2: (a)` - Rendering a collection, modules
* What's the difference between an experienced JavaScript programmer and a rookie? The experienced one uses console.log 10-100 times more.
* When something does not work, don't just guess what's wrong. Instead, log or use some other way of debugging.
* the list items, i.e. the elements generated by the `map()` method, must each have a unique key value: an attribute called key.
* Notice the use of `map()`. `map()` always creates a new array.
* Anti-pattern: Array Indexes as Keys _(see readings)_.
* Common practice is to declare each component in their own file as an ES6-module, in their folder `components`.
* To import components according to ^ => `'./components/Note'`

### `Part 2: (b)` - Forms
* How do we access the data contained in the form's input element?
  * There are many ways to accomplish this; the first method we will take a look at is through the use of so-called controlled components.
* Since we assigned a piece of the App component's state as the value attribute of the input element, the App component now controls the behavior of the input element.
* My head suddenly can't wrap around the fact of using `useState()`
