### `Part 2: (a)` - Rendering a collection, modules
* What's the difference between an experienced JavaScript programmer and a rookie? The experienced one uses console.log 10-100 times more.
* When something does not work, don't just guess what's wrong. Instead, log or use some other way of debugging.
* the list items, i.e. the elements generated by the `map()` method, must each have a unique key value: an attribute called key.
* Notice the use of `map()`. `map()` always creates a new array.
* Anti-pattern: Array Indexes as Keys _(see readings)_.
* Common practice is to declare each component in their own file as an ES6-module, in their folder `components`.
* To import components according to ^ => `'./components/Note'`
