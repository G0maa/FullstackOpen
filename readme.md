### This is my try at FSO2022, first commit at 20/04/2022

#### Since FSO is fond of anecdotes, I'll drop one too, I've been reading "The Pragmatic Programmer" lately so:

```
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.‚Äù - Admiral Dr. Grace Hopper
```

- ~~I am not sure if I am going to continue this course~~, generally it looks _better_ than [Mahara-Tehc](https://maharatech.gov.eg/), ~but I am hesitating.~
- As of now I finished the [HTML & CSS course](https://maharatech.gov.eg/course/view.php?id=36).
- ~~I may try practicing at [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/).~~
  - Didn't happen :c
- ~~Contemplating the idea of starting with the [TheOdinProject](TheOdinproject.com) before this one.~~
  - I didn't give much thought to `TOP` but `FSO` wasn't _that_ hard for me.
- Rabena Yewafa2ny üòÉ
- ~~Reading is **VERY** boring.~~ You get used to it.
- For parts 4 and 5 and possibly later some I moved practices out of the repo when solving them, them moved them back to the repo again after finishing the part, they have their .git files renamed and ignored.

- To revise GraphQL, not all problems are solved _well_.
- _Stopped at:_ `Part 11 - Finished`, skipped part 10 for now, or doing both 10 & 11 unsure.
- _Total Time:_ `~245H`, revise after me I don't update this one always.
- Since nearing the end of `Part7` I am yet again presented with an ever irking question, `"What's my next steps?"`, particulary after finishing `FSO`, **and its project**.
  - **More backend... how?**
  - Probably need to finish [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/skills-algorithms-cpp/) algorithms course.
  - Database course?
    - [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/database-engines-crash-course/)
    - [or this?](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/schedule.html)
    - What the difference?
  - Networks course?
  - [Security?](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/module-2.1)
  - More DevOps? (Probably No.)
    - [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/)
    - [DevOps with Kubernetes](https://devopswithkubernetes.com/)
  - Micro services? or different architectures at that.
  - Mentorship/Internship/Job search?
  - Open source contribution?
