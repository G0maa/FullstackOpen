### This is my try at FSO2022, first commit at 20/04/2022
* I am not sure if I am going to continue this course, generally it looks _better_ than [Mahara-Tehc](https://maharatech.gov.eg/), ~but I am hesitating.~
  * `FSO` all the way :)
* As of now I finished the [HTML & CSS course](https://maharatech.gov.eg/course/view.php?id=36).
* ~~I may try practicing at [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/).~~
  * Didn't happen :c
* Contemplating the idea of starting with the [TheOdinProject](TheOdinproject.com) before this one.
  * I didn't give much thought to `TOP` but `FSO` wasn't _that_ hard for me.
* Rabena Yewafa2ny ðŸ˜ƒ
* ~~Reading is **VERY** boring.~~ You get used to it.
