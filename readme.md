### This is my try at FSO2022, first commit at 20/04/2022

#### Since FSO is fond of anecdotes, I'll drop one too, I've been reading "The Pragmatic Programmer" lately so:

```
"Stop quoting laws at us. We carry swords,"  - Pompey
```

- I was used to video-coruses before `FSO`:
  - At first reading is boring, but you eventually get used to it.
- Some old _roadmaps_ -unvisited-:
  - [Mahara-Tehc](https://maharatech.gov.eg/)
  - [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/)
  - [TheOdinProject](TheOdinproject.com)
- For parts 4 and 5 and possibly later some I moved practices out of the repo when solving them, them moved them back to the repo again after finishing the part, they have their .git files renamed and ignored.
- To revise GraphQL, not all problems are solved _well_.

### Some metrics:

- _Stopped at:_ `Part 13 - Finished`, Remaining parts: part10.
- _Total Time:_ `~289.5H`.

### What to do after FSO? - Mostly orederd

- Since nearing the end of `Part7` I am yet again presented with an ever irking question, `"What are my next steps?"`, particulary after finishing `FSO`, **and its project**.
  - **More backend... how?**
    - Take a look at [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
    - [Learn Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/)
    - Read Node.js Documentation?
    - [Read this book](https://www.nodejsdesignpatterns.com/)
    - [egFWD... again?](https://egfwd.com/specializtion/web-development-advanced/)
  - Probably need to finish [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/skills-algorithms-cpp/) algorithms course.
  - Database course?
    - [Udemy - Hussien Nasser](https://www.udemy.com/course/database-engines-crash-course/)
    - [CMU](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/schedule.html)
    - [FCC - Relational Database](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/)
  - More Cloud-y stuff? e.g. `AWS`
    - [egFWD](https://egfwd.com/new-catlog)
  - Securtiy?
    - [Cyper Security MOOC](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/module-2.1)
    - [FCC - Information Security](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/)
  - Networks course? (Probably No.)
  - More DevOps? (Probably No.)
    - [DevOps with Docker](https://devopswithdocker.com/)
    - [DevOps with Kubernetes](https://devopswithkubernetes.com/)
  - Micro services? or different architectures at that.
  - Mentorship/Internship/Job search?
  - Open source contribution?

### What technologies did I learn so-far, during the time of FSO?

- (Functional) ReactJS
  - State maganement: Redux, Hooks, ?GraphQL?
- MongoDB (NoSQL)
- PostgreSQL
- NodeJS (Express)
  - Authentication using JWT.
- TypeScript
- CI/CD (Github Actions)
- Containers (some Docker).
- Testing:
  - Jest (Integration Testing (API), Unit testing for React)
  - Cypress (E2E).
- Deployment using Heroku (welp that didn't age well?)
- Deployment using fly.io
- Deployment using Deta
- GraphQL (Client and server), needs more time though.
- Git & Github (Unrelated to FSO).
- What to study/revise during/after FSO (Technology wise, not science wise)?
  - GraphQL.
  - Websocket.
  - How to API-testing with other stuff than Jest?
  - ...
  - **Make projects**.
