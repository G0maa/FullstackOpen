### This is my try at FSO2022, first commit at 20/04/2022

#### Since FSO is fond of anecdotes, I'll drop one too, I've been reading "The Pragmatic Programmer" lately so:

```
“It’s easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.” - Admiral Dr. Grace Hopper
```

- I am not sure if I am going to continue this course, generally it looks _better_ than [Mahara-Tehc](https://maharatech.gov.eg/), ~but I am hesitating.~
  - `FSO` all the way :)
- As of now I finished the [HTML & CSS course](https://maharatech.gov.eg/course/view.php?id=36).
- ~~I may try practicing at [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/).~~
  - Didn't happen :c
- Contemplating the idea of starting with the [TheOdinProject](TheOdinproject.com) before this one.
  - I didn't give much thought to `TOP` but `FSO` wasn't _that_ hard for me.
- Rabena Yewafa2ny 😃
- ~~Reading is **VERY** boring.~~ You get used to it.
- For parts 4 and 5 and possibly later some I moved practices out of the repo when solving them, them moved them back to the repo again after finishing the part, they have their .git files renamed and ignored.
- `rm -rf .git` => `npm install` => ?

- To revise GraphQL, not all problems are solved _well_.
- _Stopped at:_ `Part 9 - Finished`.
- _Total Time:_ `~211H`, revise after me I don't update this one always.
- Since nearing the end of `Part7` I am yet again presented with an ever irking question, `"What's my next steps?"`, particulary after finishing `FSO`, **and its project**.
  - Database course?
    - [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/database-engines-crash-course/)
    - Anohter MOOC
  - Networks course?
  - [Security?](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/module-2.1)
  - More DevOps?
  - Micro services? or different architectures at that.
  - Internship/Job search?
  - Open source contribution?

- What technologies did I learn so-far, during the time of FSO?
  - (Functional) ReactJS
    - State maganement: Redux, Hooks, ?GraphQL?
  - MongoDB (NoSQL)

    - Authentication using JWT.

    - Jest (Integration Testing (API), Unit testing for React)
    - Cypress (E2E).
  - Deployment using Heroku (welp that didn't age well?)
  - GraphQL (Client and server), needs more time though.
  - Git & Github (Unrelated to FSO).
- What to study/revise during/after FSO?
  - GraphQL.
  - Websocket.

  - ...
