### Prolouge
* I am not sure if I am going to continue this course, generally it looks _better_ than [Mahara-Tehc](https://maharatech.gov.eg/), but I am hesitating.
* As of now I finished the [HTML & CSS course](https://maharatech.gov.eg/course/view.php?id=36).
* I may try practicing at [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io/).
* Contemplating the idea of starting with the [TheOdinProject](TheOdinproject.com) before this one.
